# Faulty Point Unit: ABI Poisoning Attacks on Intel SGX

[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/fritzalder/faulty-point-unit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/github/fritzalder/faulty-point-unit)

This repository collects source code and data to reproduce the research published in our paper "Faulty Point Unit: ABI Poisoning Attacks on Intel SGX" to appear at [ACSAC'20](https://www.acsac.org/).

## Abstract

This paper analyzes a previously overlooked attack surface that allows unprivileged adversaries to impact supposedly secure floating-point computations in Intel SGX enclaves through the Application Binary Interface (ABI). In a comprehensive study across 7 widely used industry-standard and research enclave shielding runtimes, we show that control and state registers of the x87 Floating-Point Unit(FPU) and Intel Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) are not always properly sanitized on enclave entry. First, we abuse the adversary's control over precision and rounding modes as a novel "ABI-level fault injection" primitive to silently corrupt enclaved floating-point operations, enabling a new class of stealthy, integrity-only attacks that disturb the result of SGX enclave computations. Our analysis reveals that this threat is especially relevant for applications that use the older x87 FPU, which is still being used under certain conditions for high-precision operations by modern compilers like `gcc`. We exemplify the potential impact of ABI-level quality-degradation attacks in a case study of an enclaved machine learning service and in a larger analysis on the SPEC benchmark programs. Second,we explore the impact on enclave confidentiality by showing that the adversary's control over floating-point exception masks can be abused as an innovative controlled channel to detect FPU usage and to recover enclaved multiplication operands in certain scenarios. Our findings, affecting 5 out of the 7 studied runtimes, demonstrate the fallacy and challenges of implementing high-assurance trusted execution environments on contemporary x86 hardware. We responsibly disclosed our findings to the vendors and were assigned two CVEs, leading to patches in the Intel SGX-SDK, Microsoft OpenEnclave, and the Rust compiler's SGX target.

## Artifact description

In this artifact, we provide the means to reproduce all of our experimental results. More specifically, the repository is organized following the tables and figures in the paper. The following table overviews the different artifacts and further details which of them can be reproduced in SGX simulation mode in the Docker container we further describe below. A full reproducible build and reference output for all of the attacks that can be ran in the Docker SGX simulator can be viewed in the [Travis Continuous Integration log](https://travis-ci.org/github/fritzalder/faulty-point-unit).

Due to licensing and copyright restrictions with the proprietary SPEC 2017 suite, we can only provide the used configuration files and detailed instructions how to reproduce our results for people who already bought the SPEC CPU 2017 suite. Please note however, that obtaining the raw data for the SPEC benchmarks summarized in Table 4 takes several CPU weeks. For the artifact evaluation, we therefore do *not* expect artifact reviewers to generate the raw data themselves. We instead provide the log outputs of the full SPEC runs with detailed instructions of how to reproduce the summary in Table 4.|

**\*Note (on SPEC licensing).** Due to licensing and copyright restrictions with the proprietary SPEC CPU 2017 suite, we can only provide the used configuration files and detailed instructions how to reproduce our results for people who already bought the SPEC CPU 2017 suite. Please note, however, that obtaining the raw data for the SPEC benchmarks summarized in Table 4 takes several CPU weeks. For the artifact evaluation, we therefore do **\_\_not\_\_** expect artifact reviewers to generate the raw data themselves. We instead provide the log outputs of the full SPEC runs with detailed instructions of how to reproduce the summary in Table 4.

**Note (runtime).** The table below lists a rough time estimate for the runtime of each artifact for the reviewer's convenience.

## Preparation and setup

Detailed instructions to reproduce the above artifacts are provided in the READMEs of the respective subdirectories. In this section, we first overview the general setup common to all the experiments.

### Building the Intel SGX simulator

All of the attacks described in our paper were performed on *real SGX hardware*. For the convenience of the artifact evaluation however, we ensured that all of our main results can also be ran in the official Intel SGX simulator, i.e., on normal processors without Intel SGX support. To easily run the simulator, we further provide an installation script and a Docker container with all the dependencies preinstalled.

**Note (simulation validity).** Simulation mode does assuredly _not_ affect the validity of our attacks, as we exploit software sanitization oversights that occur in code that is agnostic to whether the enclave executes on real hardware or in a simulator.

**Note (hardware access).** Almost all of the enclave shielding runtimes that we studied offer a simulation mode (i.e., Intel SGX-SDK, OpenEnclave, LKL, GoTEE). Rust-EDP does not, however, and we can therefore not offer a simulation mode for our proof-of-concept attacks on the Rust-EDP runtime. This is only a concern for Table 2 (`02_table2_affected_runtimes`). To test the artifacts in a real hardware environment, we will provide ACSAC artifact reviewers with SSH access to a preinstalled SGX-enabled lab machine.

## Quickstart: Pulling the latest Docker image

For a quickstart, you can pull the latest Docker image that is generated by the Travis continuous integration. Do this by first installing Docker (loosely based on <https://docs.docker.com/get-started/>):

### 1. Install docker

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install docker.io
```

#### 2. Configure user access

```bash
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami) # add users to docker group, then re-login.
```

#### 3. Check your docker installation

```bash
$ docker run hello-world
[...]
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
[...]
```

#### 4. Quickstart with pulling the latest Docker image

We provide a Makefile target to easily pull the latest Docker image that has been built by the Travis continuous integration. This pulls and creates a new interactive session in that Docker container to directly start with the artifact. Once inside the Docker container, you will still need to run the installation script and source the desired SDK (detailed below). A quick start with the Docker container looks as follows:

```bash
# Pull latest Docker build and start an interactive session inside the Docker container
$ make pull
docker run -i -h "badf1oa7" -t fritzalder/sgx-fpu

To get started, see README.md in the current directory

root@badf1oa7$ ./sdk_helper.sh install_sim       # Install dependencies
...
root@badf1oa7$ source ./sdk_helper.sh vulnerable # Switch to the vulnerable Intel SGX SDK v2.7.1
root@badf1oa7$ cd 01_table1_basic-poc            
root@badf1oa7$ ./eval_simulator.sh               # Reproduce basic proof of concept attack
root@badf1oa7$ source ../sdk_helper.sh patched   # Now reproduce same attack with patched SDK v2.8.0
root@badf1oa7$ ./eval_simulator.sh
```

### Switching Intel SGX-SDK versions

This artifact demonstrates an attack that existed in the Intel SGX-SDK in version 2.7.1 and was patched following with version 2.8.0. As such, we provide an easy to use install script that allows to reproduce the attack in both versions and be able to verify its mitigation in the patched SDK version.

We provide the script `sdk_helper.sh` to install and switch between the two relevant Intel SGX-SDK versions. Simply run `./sdk_helper.sh install` to install the relevant dependencies in hardware mode or `./sdk_helper install_sim` to install the dependencies in simulation mode if you have no intention of running the attack on real hardware. As described earlier, since this attack exploits software sanitization oversights, the simulation yields the same results when reproducing the data as real hardware will.

The `sdk_helper.sh` script has two options to switch between Intel SGX-SDK versions: `sdk_helper.sh vulnerable` and `sdk_helper.sh patched` to switch to the Intel SGX-SDK 2.7.1 and 2.8 respectively. **Note** that in order for the script to perform this switch reliably, this script needs to be called with `source` so that the environment variables that are set are inherited by your shell. As such, always call the script as `source sdk_helper.sh vulnerable` and `source sdk_helper.sh patched`!

Use `./sdk_helper.sh help` to print an overview of commands and tasks the script performs.

## Intel SGX-SDK bug in Ubuntu 20.04LTS

As of release of this artifact, there is a known issue with the Intel SGX-SDK and Ubuntu LTS 20.04 as reported [here](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-sgx/4db41057-910c-b686-0428-474debe382c1@fortanix.com/), [here](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx/issues/569), and [here](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx/pull/515). This is an issue in the SGX driver and does, therefore, *not* affect the simulator described above. The below workaround is, hence, only needed when running the attack on real SGX hardware on Ubuntu 20.04.

Since we are deliberately installing an obsolete Intel SGX-SDK to make it vulnerable to a known attack, we can not rely on future releases to patch this issue. A quick workaround is to set `mount -o remount,exec /dev` to circumvent the new behavior of Ubuntu 20.04. The `sdk_helper` sets this before installing if it detects the mentioned Ubuntu version. We **explicitly** warn of possible side-effects. Additionally, since this setting resets on reboot, a user might have to simply rerun the installation with the `sdk_helper` after a reboot.

## Building your own Docker container

Optionally, to build a new Docker container instead of the automatically built one, use these commands:

```bash
$ make build
$ make run 
docker run -i -h "badf1oa7" -t sgx-fpu

```

## Running on real hardware

If you want to reproduce above artifacts on real hardware instead of using the SGX simulators, you can follow these  instructions. 

### Ubuntu, RHEL, SUSE

We provide the `sdk_helper.sh` script that can be instructed to do a installation of the hardware driver via `sudo ./sdk_helper.sh install`.
One installed, the `sdk_helper.sh` script can be used to switch between patched and vulnerable SDK: `./sdk_helper.sh vulnerable` | `./sdk_helper.sh patched`. 

If needed, general installation instructions are provided by Intel [here](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/latest/linux-latest/docs/Intel_SGX_Installation_Guide_Linux_2.11_Open_Source.pdf).

Potentially you also still have to start the aesmd service by running:

```bash
$ sudo service aesmd start
```

### Arch Linux, Manjaro

The driver can be installed from the AUR [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-sgx-driver-dkms-git/).

A docker image with the Intel SGX PSW installed can be obtained in the following way.

```bash
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intel/linux-sgx/sgx_2.11/linux/installer/docker/Dockerfile
$ docker build --target aesm --build-arg https_proxy=$https_proxy \
             --build-arg http_proxy=$http_proxy -t sgx_aesm -f ./Dockerfile ./
$ rm Dockerfile
$ docker volume create --driver local --opt type=tmpfs --opt device=tmpfs --opt o=rw aesmd-socket
```

At the time of writing the AUR still contains the Legacy Launch Control driver and you can create the container with the following command

```bash
$ docker run --env http_proxy --env https_proxy --device=/dev/isgx -v /dev/log:/dev/log -v aesmd-socket:/var/run/aesmd -it sgx_aesm
```

If however the [SGX Flexible Launch Control driver](https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives/driver/linux) is installed on your system or the upcoming patches to the driver have been upstreamed you will need to create the container as follows

```bash
$ docker run --env http_proxy --env https_proxy --device=/dev/sgx/enclave --device=/dev/sgx/provision -v /dev/log:/dev/log -v aesmd-socket:/var/run/aesmd -it sgx_aesm
```

##### Running the container in Arch Linux for this repository

To start the docker container that has been built by the Travis CI you can run the following.

```bash
$ docker pull fritzalder/sgx-fpu
```

For the SGX Legacy Launch Control driver:

```bash
$ docker run -h "badf1oa7" --device=/dev/isgx -v aesmd-socket:/var/run/aesmd -it fritzalder/sgx-fpu
```

For the SGX Flexible Launch Control driver:

```bash
$ docker run -h "badf1oa7" --device=/dev/sgx/enclave -v aesmd-socket:/var/run/aesmd -it fritzalder/sgx-fpu
```
